Overview
---------
This module allows an administrator to restrict editing access
to user account/profile fields.

Fields can be restricted via
  "Adminster >> Site configuration >> User ReadOnly"


Notes
------
Due to the complexity of some fields like password and profile date,
those fields are removed from the edit form, rather than disabled.

Note, disabling required fields, like with the Profile module, could
make other permitted profile edits impossible for your users.

Requirements
------------
* Drupal 7.x
